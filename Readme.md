# ML Models From Scratch

This repo contains simple Python implementations of core machine learning algorithms written from scratch (using only NumPy, no scikit-learn for training). The goal is learning and understanding the math + code behind each model, not production speed.

## Implemented Models

## Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression

Multiple Linear Regression

Gradient Descent (Batch / Mini-batch / Stochastic)

Ridge Regression (L2 regularization)

Classification Models

## Logistic Regression
Sigmoid Function
Perceptron Algorithm

Each model lives in its own .py file for clarity.

## Requirements

Python 3.8+

numpy
